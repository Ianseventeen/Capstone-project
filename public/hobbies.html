    <h2>Efficienty</h2>
    <p>I am very curious about effiencient enviroments, and because of it, i try a lot of linux distros, and design patters for efficiency, but the most beautiful and the one that real works for me is the omakub, an developer setup</p>

    <h2>Customizing</h2>
    <p>The omakub also appears here, after trying a lot of Nvim "cases", and also trying lazyvim, i arrived on the omakub setup, mixing lazyvim and Zellig</p>
